# To-Do List App

## Overview
The To-Do List App is a simple, user-friendly application designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently. This application allows you to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight and easy to use.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Mark as Completed**: Check off tasks that you have completed.
- **Persistent Data**: Tasks are stored in local storage, so your to-do list is saved even if you refresh the page.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: The structure of the app.
- **CSS**: The styling and layout of the app.
- **JavaScript**: The functionality and interactivity of the app.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash

    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ToDo_List_App
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

2. **Deleting a Task**: Click the "Delete" button (usually represented by a trash icon) next to the task you want to remove.
3. **Marking a Task as Completed**: Click on the task to toggle its completed status. Completed tasks will be visually differentiated (e.g., with a strikethrough).
